        "* Missing values in a dataset are simply the absence of data in one or more columns of a record. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as incomplete data or data entry errors. Handling missing values is essential because they can have a significant impact on the accuracy and reliability of data analysis and modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "* If missing values are not handled properly, it can lead to biased or incomplete results, which can negatively affect decision-making processes. For instance, missing values can result in incorrect averages, distributions, and other statistical measures, leading to inaccurate insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "* There are several methods to handle missing values, such as deleting the missing values, replacing the missing values with a measure of central tendency, or using machine learning algorithms that can handle missing data. Some algorithms that are not affected by missing values are decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. These algorithms are capable of working with incomplete data and can impute missing values on their own, making them useful in real-world scenarios where missing values are common."

        "* Transformation: Another approach is to transform the data using mathematical functions such as logarithms or square roots to reduce the impact of outliers.\n",
